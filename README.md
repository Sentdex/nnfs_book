### Neural Networks from Scratch (NNFS) book code

This repository is contains the code from the book NNFS([link](https://nnfs.io/)) and the idea is to arrange the chapter lectures into packages so that its easier to use the code in either jupyter-notebooks or in the modules by importing them.

Additionally added Convolution layers(conv1d,conv2d,conv3d) and max-pooling layers(max-pool1d,max-pol2d,maxpool3d) to be able to create Convolutional neural networks.


Adding normalization layers(batch-normalization).



This repo is for training and educational purposes.
