# Neural Networks from Scratch (NNFS) book code

Code from the NNFS book (https://nnfs.io) separated by chapter. The NNFS book is written with the Python programming lanauge. If you're interested in seeing this same content, but with 40+ other programming languages, check out: https://github.com/sentdex/nnfsix


Idea of the branch is to restructure the classes into packages, and provide training examples(MNIST etc..),and to add a batch-normalization layer to it.
